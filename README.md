# A new Life

Working title for a browser based game.\
[A new Life](https://life.afe-gmdg.de/)

This project is in its pre alpha concept phase - so expect a lot of changes!

## 3d Coordinate System
I like the 3d Coordinate system that is used by Blender. Blender uses a
Right-Hand-Coordinate-System, therefore I stay with this:
- Left to Right is -x to x
- Back to Front is -y to y
- Bottom to Top is -z to z
